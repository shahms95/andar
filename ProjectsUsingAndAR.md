## Chemical Reaction Game ##
Chemical Reaction Game was student project at the University of Malta.
The aim of this game is to help the students learn about the different types of chemicals and their reaction when mixed together. Since this is a simulation game, the student will learn more about certain everyday objects and simple chemicals, and the reactions these may cause.
When the application is loaded, the user will use a hologram to place in front of the camera so that a beaker will appear on the screen. The user will have a virtual beaker and a few chemicals available to him. To play the game, the user has to select two objects/chemicals. Mixing occurs when the mobile device is tilted forwards. Depending on the type of chemicals placed inside the beaker, a reaction will follow, such as an explosion. According to the reaction, the beaker will change its colour. The user will also have control of the beaker by moving the device.
